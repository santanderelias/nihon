# Nihon - Japanese Language Learning App

Nihon is a simple and effective web application designed to help you learn and practice Japanese characters, including Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. The app uses a personalized quiz system that adapts to your learning progress, making it an ideal tool for beginners and those looking to reinforce their knowledge.

## Features

- **Character Quizzes:** Practice your knowledge of Japanese characters with interactive quizzes. The app currently includes:
  - **Hiragana:** The basic Japanese phonetic script.
  - **Katakana:** Used for foreign loanwords, emphasis, and onomatopoeia.
  - **Kanji:** Logographic characters borrowed from Chinese.
  - **Dakuten and Handakuten:** Modified characters to represent different sounds.

- **Personalized Learning:** The app tracks your performance on each character. It uses a weighted system to prioritize characters you've answered incorrectly, ensuring you get more practice where you need it most.

- **Example Words:** To help you build your vocabulary, the app displays example words that use the character you are currently being quizzed on. This provides context and helps you understand how characters are used in real words.

- **Built-in Dictionary:** Look up Japanese words and their meanings using the integrated dictionary. This feature allows you to search for words, view their readings (in Hiragana or Katakana), and see their English definitions.

- **Dark Mode:** Switch between light and dark themes for a comfortable viewing experience at any time of day.

- **Progress Tracking:** The app keeps track of your correct and incorrect answers for each character. You can view your statistics to see which characters you need to work on.
